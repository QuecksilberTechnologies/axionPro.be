# Locked Fix Regression Protocol

This file is the canonical registry for user-approved fixes whose behavior must
remain stable while later work is performed. It applies to every contributor,
account, automated agent and session working on this project.

## Mandatory first-read rule

1. Read this entire file before inspecting, changing or testing application
   code, database state, configuration or API behavior.
2. Read the repository `AGENTS.md` and any feature-specific reference named by
   it before starting work.
3. Before fixing another feature, identify every locked item that the proposed
   work can affect through shared handlers, repositories, entities, database
   tables, middleware, permissions, response contracts or UI consumers.
4. Run the affected locked items' **pre-change regression gate** before making
   the new change. If a gate fails, stop the new feature work, record the actual
   failure and tell the user. Do not hide the failure or relabel it as unrelated.
5. After the authorized change, rerun the same locked gates and the new
   feature's tests. A new fix is not locked until both sets pass and its evidence
   is recorded.

These regression runs protect established behavior and therefore are not
documentation-only reruns.

## Angular authorization boundary

- Do not edit, format, generate, build, test, install dependencies in, or
  otherwise change the Angular workspace unless the user explicitly authorizes
  Angular work in the current request.
- Backend work, an API error, a related feature name or an existing UI consumer
  does not imply permission to touch Angular.
- If an authorized backend change requires an Angular contract change, prepare
  the backend result and explain the exact required UI change. Wait for explicit
  Angular authorization before applying it.
- When Angular work is authorized, read the Angular repository's `AGENTS.md`
  before touching that workspace and run every applicable UI lock gate.

## Meaning of a locked fix

A `LOCKED` entry establishes its listed observable behavior as a regression
baseline. Later work must not silently change that behavior, API contract,
transaction outcome, permission path, persistence rule or user-facing error.

- Only an explicit user instruction can change, unlock or retire locked
  behavior.
- A refactor is not permission to alter a locked result.
- An expanded test suite may add coverage, but it must preserve the original
  locked assertions unless the user approves a behavior change.
- Skipped, blocked and not-run checks are never passes.
- Local verification is not deployed acceptance.
- Never store credentials, tokens, real identity numbers or unredacted personal
  documents in this registry or its evidence reports.

## Required workflow for every small fix

### 1. Define the requested scope

- Restate the exact defect and intended result.
- List the files, APIs, tables and consumers likely to be affected.
- Ask the user if intended behavior is unclear; do not invent a flow.

### 2. Check existing locks before changing code

- Select applicable entries from the registry below.
- Run each selected entry's pre-change gate exactly as documented.
- Record passed, failed, skipped and blocked counts honestly.
- If no lock applies, state why in the new scenario report.

### 3. Implement only the authorized fix

- Preserve existing project patterns, permission flow, regions, comments,
  constants, enums and mappings.
- Do not combine an unrelated cleanup, refactor or UI change with the fix.
- Do not weaken an existing assertion just to make a regression pass.

### 4. Verify and lock the result

- Rerun all applicable pre-change gates as post-change gates.
- Add meaningful cases to an existing relevant test when that is the established
  test location. Create a new suite only when no suitable suite exists.
- Create the required scenario report under
  `docs/testing/<module>/<scenario>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and link it from the test
  indexes required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Add or update one registry entry below. Mark it `LOCKED` only after required
  local checks pass. Record deployed verification separately.

## Lock entry requirements

Every entry must include:

- stable lock ID, date and status;
- user-approved behavior that must remain unchanged;
- protected APIs, code areas and persistence objects;
- exact pre-change and post-change regression commands;
- expected assertions or minimum result;
- evidence report;
- local and deployed verification status;
- any approved exception or remaining acceptance item.

## LOCK-TENANT-REG-001: Tenant registration transaction and actionable errors

### Locked behavior

- Public and Host tenant registration follow the established transaction flow.
- A failed creation does not leave a partially committed tenant graph.
- Duplicate email is rejected before a transaction begins.
- Known database conflicts and unexpected failures return a safe, actionable
  stage-specific message and stable error code. Raw exception, SQL and database
  details remain server-log-only.
- Request cancellation rolls back and returns a clear cancellation result.
- Verification-email failure after commit does not roll back the created tenant;
  the result reports that the email was not sent.
- Tenant registration does not implicitly create obsolete Insurance or Leave
  policy types.
- The Angular registration screen, when explicitly authorized for UI work,
  displays the API message plus distinct validation details and uses clear
  fallbacks when no detail is available.

### Protected areas

- `axionpro.application/Features/RegistrationCmd/Handlers/CreateTenantCommandHandler.cs`
- `axionpro.application/Constants/AppConstants.cs`
- `axionpro.api/Controllers/Tenant/TenantController.cs`
- `axionpro.automationtests/Unit/HostApiRegressionTests.cs`
- Tenant, tenant subscription, security key, location, employee, role,
  permission and tenant-profile persistence used by registration.
- Angular registration response contract, component and existing component
  specification. The Angular authorization boundary above still applies.

### Required backend gate

Run before and after any change that can affect this lock:

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostApiRegressionTests.Tenant_creation_awaits_dependencies_and_preserves_transaction_outcome" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected locked baseline: all named public and Host cases pass. At lock time the
result was 14 passed, 0 failed and 0 skipped.

For database, entity, repository, transaction or registration-persistence
changes, also run the opt-in rollback probe against the explicitly approved
Development settings:

```powershell
$env:AXIONPRO_HOST_DB_SETTINGS=(Resolve-Path '.\axionpro.api\appsettings.Development.json').Path
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostApiRegressionTests.Tenant_creation_real_database_rollback_probe" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected locked baseline: 2 passed, 0 failed and 0 skipped, with both transactions
rolled back and no test tenant persisted. If the environment variable or
database is unavailable, record the probe as BLOCKED or SKIPPED and do not claim
database regression acceptance.

### Required Angular gate

Run only after the user explicitly authorizes Angular work:

```powershell
bun run test -- --include src/app/features/authentication/registration/registration.spec.ts
bun run build -- --configuration production
```

Expected locked baseline: the focused registration specification passes (44
tests at lock time) and the production bundle builds successfully.

### Known data-integrity prerequisite

Tenant cleanup must not leave orphan tenant-encryption-key rows. The lock-time
failure was caused by four orphan `TenantEncryptionKeys` rows colliding with
reused tenant identities; the local orphans were removed and the final orphan
count was zero. Do not delete or alter tenant data for a regression run without
the user's explicit authorization.

### Acceptance state

- Local backend mocked gate: PASS.
- Local PostgreSQL rollback gate: PASS.
- Local Angular focused tests and production build: PASS under the authorization
  that created this lock.
- Deployed end-to-end registration: PENDING and must not be reported as passed
  until independently executed and reconciled.

## LOCK-ROLE-TYPE-002: Tenant role-type response mapping and API-backed DDL

Status: **SUPERSEDED on 2026-10-04 by `LOCK-ROLE-PERSONA-007`** with explicit
user authorization to replace the four original display labels. Numeric values,
permission behavior and the API-backed DDL architecture remain protected.

### Locked behavior

- Persisted Tenant role type `1` displays as `Super Admin`.
- Persisted Tenant role type `2` displays as `Employee`.
- Persisted Tenant role type `3` displays as `Manager`.
- Persisted Tenant role type `4` displays as `Client`, never `Unknown`.
- An unsupported numeric role type uses the safe `Unknown` fallback.
- Role GET and login role responses resolve names through the same centralized
  constants mapping.
- `GET /api/Role/type-options` is bearer-authenticated and returns the supported
  1–4 option catalogue from the same constants. It accepts no ModuleId or
  OperationId and deliberately bypasses the Role module-operation pipeline.
- Existing Role create/update/list/delete, permission and bulk-import requests
  retain their established permission behavior.
- Angular Role Add, Edit and filter controls use the API-backed shared signal;
  no hardcoded `ROLE_TYPES` list may replace it. The Angular permission
  interceptor must not attach permission IDs to this lookup.

### Protected areas

- `axionpro.application/Constants/AppConstants.cs`, Tenant Role Types region.
- `axionpro.application/Mappings/MappingProfile.cs`, mappings from `Role` to
  `GetRoleResponseDTO` and `NewLoginRoleDTO`.
- `axionpro.application/Features/RoleCmd/Handlers/GetRoleTypeOptionsQueryHandler.cs`.
- `axionpro.application/Features/RoleCmd/RolePermissionBehavior.cs`, the narrow
  `GetRoleTypeOptionsQuery` exception only.
- `axionpro.api/Controllers/Role/RoleController.cs`, `GET type-options`.
- `axionpro.automationtests/Unit/RoleTypeMappingTests.cs`.
- `GET /api/Role/get` role-type fields and login role-type display fields.
- Angular `roles-api.ts`, `role-dialog`, `roles-list`, role interfaces and the
  `/Role/type-options` interceptor exclusion.

### Required backend gate

Run before and after any change that can affect this lock:

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=RoleTypeMapping" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected locked baseline: 9 passed, 0 failed and 0 skipped. The assertions cover
types 1, 2, 3, 4 and an unsupported value across the central resolver and response
mappings, the four-option query output, the no-permission pipeline exception and
the authenticated controller route. A regular Role query still rejects missing
permission IDs, proving the exception does not weaken existing Role operations.

Because `AppConstants.cs` is also protected by `LOCK-TENANT-REG-001`, changes to
that file must additionally run that lock's backend gate.

### Required Angular gate

Run before and after changes to the protected Role option consumers or interceptor:

```powershell
C:\latestAxionProUI\axionpro-app\node_modules\.bin\ng.exe test --project axionpro --include C:\latestAxionProUI\axionpro-app\src\app\features\roles\role-dialog\role-dialog.spec.ts --include C:\latestAxionProUI\axionpro-app\src\app\core\services\roles-api.spec.ts --include C:\latestAxionProUI\axionpro-app\src\app\core\interceptors\module-operation-routes.spec.ts --watch=false
```

Expected locked baseline: 3 files and 69 tests pass.

### Acceptance state

- Local backend gate: PASS, 9/9.
- Shared constants tenant-registration gate: PASS, 14/14.
- Angular Role option gate: PASS, 69/69.
- Angular production build: PASS.
- Authenticated local Role GET JSON: PENDING.
- Authenticated local `GET /api/Role/type-options`: PENDING.
- Deployed Role GET: PENDING.
- Deployed Role type options and UI acceptance: PENDING.
- Angular Role create/edit dropdown: known hardcoded 1–3 list, unchanged and
  outside this backend lock.

## LOCK-EMP-CONTACT-003: Employee contact relations, initial row and location cascade

### Locked behavior

- Employee contact relations come from backend `EmergencyContactRelation`; no
  Angular `RELATIONS` catalogue may replace it.
- Values 1–16 and 99 remain stable. `Owner` is value 16 and `Other` is 99.
- `GET /api/Employee/Contact/relation-options` is bearer-authenticated, accepts
  no ModuleId/OperationId or employee ID. As explicitly requested by the user,
  only bearer-token verification applies; no tenant/user database or permission
  query runs. This follows the existing Role-options boundary. Other Employee
  requests retain the established permission pipeline. This corrects the initial
  draft's extra tenant-context check to match the same user request, before final acceptance.
- Normal Employee creation adds exactly one editable, active, unverified,
  non-primary EmployeeContact to the same aggregate and transaction. It copies
  only full employee name and CountryId; Relation and the remaining user-entered
  contact/address fields are null.
- Existing Contact rows remain editable and employees may create more rows
  through existing Contact CRUD authorization.
- Manual Contact Add/Edit loads Country -> State -> District -> Locality, clears
  downstream values when a parent changes, and persists nullable LocalityId.
- Contact reads return nullable LocalityId/LocalityName. The additive migration
  never rewrites or deletes existing EmployeeContact rows.
- Contact edit accepts international plus-prefixed numbers while preserving
  legacy ten-digit numbers and ownership/editable/verified guards.
- The approved public UAE seed is additive/idempotent and preserves non-AE rows.
  Missing source district membership stays explicitly Unassigned; no postal
  codes or administrative membership are invented.

### Protected areas

- `axionpro.application/Common/Enums/OperationType.cs`,
  `EmergencyContactRelation`.
- Relation DTO/query/handler, `ContactController.GetRelationOptions` and the
  narrow exception in `EmployeeTenantPermissionBehavior`.
- `EmployeeContactInfoMapperHelper.CreateInitialContact` and
  `CreateBaseEmployeeInfoCommandHandler` aggregate wiring.
- EmployeeContact entity/EF model/repository, Contact create/update/get DTOs and
  `database-scripts/AddEmployeeContactDefaultAndLocality.sql`.
- `EmployeeContactRelationAndCreationTests` and Employee profile route/permission
  characterization.
- Angular EmployeeContactsAPI, LookupStore relation/location resources, Contact
  form, Employee Manage dialog, relation pipe/display consumers and the
  `/Employee/Contact/relation-options` interceptor exclusion.

### Required backend gates

Run before and after any change that can affect this lock:

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=EmployeeContactRelation|FullyQualifiedName~EmployeeProfileCharacterizationTests" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~LocalityRefactorTests&FullyQualifiedName!~Four_country_postal_seed_is_idempotent_and_populates_locality_postal_code" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected locked baseline: 46/46 Employee contact/profile and 9/9 applicable
locality tests pass, with zero failed or skipped. The excluded historical
postal-seed test is BLOCKED by its absent
`database-scripts/SeedFourCountryPostalLocalities.sql` fixture and must never be
reported as passed until that fixture is restored or the test is explicitly
retired.

Because Employee persistence and shared constants/interceptor paths overlap
existing locks, also run their applicable gates:

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostApiRegressionTests.Tenant_creation_awaits_dependencies_and_preserves_transaction_outcome" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=RoleTypeMapping" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected baselines: Tenant 14/14 and Role 9/9 pass. For entity/repository/schema
changes, run the LOCK-TENANT-REG-001 real-database rollback probe; expected 2/2
pass with no retained test tenant.

For Contact persistence and UAE geography, also run (after applying the additive
schema script and UAE seed to the approved local target):

```powershell
$env:AXIONPRO_CONTACT_DB_SETTINGS=(Resolve-Path '.\axionpro.api\appsettings.Development.json').Path
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=EmployeeContactDatabase" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected: 2 passed, no skipped; initial contact, edit/add/read-back, UAE lookup
hierarchy and rollback cleanup are verified. The DB probe substitutes auth/email;
it does not establish running-product authenticated HTTP acceptance.

### Required Angular gates

Run only with explicit Angular authorization:

```powershell
npx ng test --watch=false --include=src/app/core/services/employee-contacts-api.spec.ts --include=src/app/shared/pipes/get-relation-name-pipe.spec.ts --include=src/app/features/user-menu/employee-profile/employee-contact-info/employee-contact-form/employee-contact-form.spec.ts --include=src/app/core/interceptors/module-operation-routes.spec.ts --include=src/app/shared/components/employee/employee-manage-dialog/employee-manage-dialog.spec.ts --include=src/app/features/user-menu/employee-profile/employee-contact-info/employee-contact-info.spec.ts --include=src/app/features/user-menu/employee-profile/employee-basic-info/employee-basic-info.spec.ts --include=src/app/features/employees/avatar-popup/avatar-popup.spec.ts
npx ng test --project axionpro --include src/app/features/roles/role-dialog/role-dialog.spec.ts --include src/app/core/services/roles-api.spec.ts --include src/app/core/interceptors/module-operation-routes.spec.ts --watch=false
npx ng build --configuration production --progress=false
```

Expected baselines: affected Employee UI 8 files/66 tests, protected Role UI 3
files/69 tests, and the production build all pass. Changed TS/HTML files must
also pass `oxfmt --check` and ESLint.

### Acceptance state

- Local backend Employee contact/profile gate: PASS, 46/46, including three
  isolated HTTP bearer cases (401/401/200), with zero persistence dependencies.
- Local locality contract gate: PASS, 9/9 applicable tests; one historical
  fixture-dependent case remains BLOCKED and excluded as documented.
- Protected tenant mocked gate: PASS, 14/14 before and after.
- Protected tenant PostgreSQL rollback probe: PASS, 2/2, no retained test tenant.
- Protected Role backend/interceptor gate: PASS, 9/9 backend and 69/69 Angular.
- Affected Angular gate: PASS, 66/66; format and ESLint PASS.
- Angular production build: PASS.
- EmployeeContact schema migration and UAE seed: APPLIED locally; second seed
  run inserted zero rows and non-AE row fingerprints stayed unchanged.
- Real Employee-create/contact edit/add/read-back and UAE repository cascade:
  PASS, 2/2 database probes; test graph rolled back with no retained account.
- Running-product authenticated employee/browser acceptance: PENDING.
- Deployed API/UI acceptance: PENDING.

## LOCK-EMP-EDU-004: Employee Education create date and score-type mapping

### Locked behavior

- `POST /api/Employee/Education/create` retains its existing authenticated Employee permission pipeline and multipart FormData contract.
- Nullable request `DateTime` start/end values map to `EmployeeEducation` nullable `DateOnly` values without changing the submitted calendar date.
- The existing numeric-string score-type contract maps to the nullable integer persistence column. A missing, non-numeric or non-positive score type returns validation failure rather than an unexpected mapping exception.
- Encoded EmployeeId handling, transaction boundaries, optional document upload, projection and repository behavior remain unchanged.

### Protected areas

- `axionpro.application/Mappings/MappingProfile.cs`, `CreateEducationRequestDTO -> EmployeeEducation` mapping.
- `axionpro.application/Features/EmployeeCmd/EducationInfo/Handlers/CreateEducationInfoCommandHandler.cs`.
- `axionpro.automationtests/Unit/EmployeeProfileCharacterizationTests.cs`, Education create mapping case.
- `POST /api/Employee/Education/create` FormData contract.

### Required backend gate

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Education_create_mapping_accepts_the_form_contract" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=EmployeeContactRelation|FullyQualifiedName~EmployeeProfileCharacterizationTests" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet build .\AxionPro.sln -c Release --no-restore --nologo
```

Expected baseline: focused mapping 1/1 and protected Employee profile/contact 46/46 pass with zero failed/skipped; Release build succeeds with zero errors.

### Acceptance state

- Local focused mapping: PASS, 1/1.
- Local protected Employee profile/contact gate: PASS, 46/46.
- Local Release build: PASS, zero errors; existing warnings remain.
- Authenticated running-product create/read-back and persistence reconciliation: PENDING.
- Deployed API/UI acceptance: PENDING.

## LOCK-EMP-BANK-005: Employee Bank sensitive fields encrypted at rest

### Locked behavior

- Bank Create and Update encrypt `AccountNumber`, `IFSCCode` and non-empty `UPIId` with the existing `IEncryptionService` and authenticated Tenant encryption key before persistence.
- Bank Get decrypts these values only inside the authenticated Tenant request before returning them over HTTPS, preserving the existing Angular mask/reveal and Edit contract.
- Delete, verification and edit-status operations preserve ciphertext and retain the existing permission and soft-delete flows.
- `EmployeeBankDetail` column capacities remain `AccountNumber varchar(128)`, `IFSCCode varchar(128)` and `UPIId varchar(512)` in EF, the schema reference and Local/Render PostgreSQL.
- Existing valid plaintext rows are migrated once; rerunning the migration validates ciphertext and never double-encrypts it.

### Protected areas

- Bank Create/Get/Update handlers under `axionpro.application/Features/EmployeeCmd/BankInfo/Handlers`.
- `ProjectionHelper.ToGetBankResponseDTOs`.
- `EmployeeBankDetail` EF mapping and `database-scripts/EncryptEmployeeBankSensitiveFields.sql`.
- `EmployeeBankEncryptionTests` and the Bank endpoints documented in `docs/UIdeveloperDoc/EMPLOYEE_PROFILE_CRUD.md`.

### Required backend gates

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "TestCategory=EmployeeBankEncryption&TestCategory!=EmployeeBankEncryptionDatabase" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "TestCategory=EmployeeContactRelation|FullyQualifiedName~EmployeeProfileCharacterizationTests" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~LocalityRefactorTests&FullyQualifiedName!~Four_country_postal_seed_is_idempotent_and_populates_locality_postal_code" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostApiRegressionTests.Tenant_creation_awaits_dependencies_and_preserves_transaction_outcome" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "TestCategory=RoleTypeMapping" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet build .\AxionPro.sln -c Release --no-restore --nologo
```

For an explicitly approved database target, set `AXIONPRO_BANK_DB_SETTINGS` to its settings file and run `TestCategory=EmployeeBankEncryptionDatabase`. The test widens the schema, migrates valid plaintext, validates existing ciphertext and commits atomically.

Expected baseline: Bank unit 1/1, Employee profile/contact 46/46, locality 9/9, Tenant 14/14 and Role 9/9 pass with zero failed/skipped; Release build succeeds with zero errors. The protected Tenant rollback probe remains 2/2 for persistence changes.

### Acceptance state

- Bank unit/decryption projection: PASS, 1/1.
- Local PostgreSQL schema/migration: PASS, 1/1; zero existing rows.
- Render PostgreSQL schema/migration: PASS, 1/1; two existing rows encrypted and verified; idempotency rerun PASS.
- Protected backend gates and Release build: PASS.
- Corrected API deployment and authenticated HTTP CRUD/read-back: PENDING. The database migration alone is not deployed API acceptance.

## LOCK-POLICY-ASSIGN-006: Applicability-safe employee policy assignment

### Locked behavior

- Candidate rows are active tenant employees included by the selected Published version's
  effective Applicability; Exclude wins an equal specificity/priority tie.
- Rows expose encoded employee ID plus employee code/type/department/designation.
- Direct and durable bulk assignment repeat the same applicability decision at write time.
- Existing durable Policy Assignment import remains the single 100+ row workflow.
- Mapping export uses the existing dynamic Policy Assignments permission pipeline.

### Protected areas and gate

- TenantPolicy assignment/candidate/export routes, GenericPolicy handlers/repository/permission
  behavior, Policy Assignment bulk validation and the UI handoff.

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~GenericPolicyApiContractTests|FullyQualifiedName~PolicyFrameworkSchemaTests|TestCategory=GenericPolicyRuleMetadata" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet build .\AxionPro.sln -c Release --no-restore --nologo
```

Expected baseline: 32 passed, 0 failed/skipped; Release build zero errors. Local contract
acceptance passes. Deployed authenticated candidate/bulk/export acceptance remains pending.

## LOCK-ROLE-PERSONA-007: Professional Tenant role-type personas

### Locked behavior

- Persisted RoleType values remain stable: 1, 2, 3 and 4.
- Their user-facing names are Tenant Administrator, Workforce User, People Manager and External User.
- Each option returns its centralized, non-empty description from `AppConstants.cs`.
- Role/list/login mappings resolve the same professional display names; unsupported values remain Unknown.
- Registration Role names remain Super-Admin, Employee, Manager and Client, preserving existing data and seed behavior.
- `GET /api/Role/type-options` keeps bearer authentication and its existing narrow no-ModuleId/OperationId lookup behavior. Other Role requests retain the permission pipeline.

### Protected areas and gate

- Tenant Role Types region in `AppConstants.cs`, Role mapping profile, options handler, permission behavior and controller route.
- Persisted numeric RoleType values and registration Role names.

```powershell
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-restore --filter "TestCategory=RoleTypeMapping" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
dotnet test .\axionpro.automationtests\axionpro.automationtests.csproj -c Release --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HostApiRegressionTests.Tenant_creation_awaits_dependencies_and_preserves_transaction_outcome" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"
```

Expected: Role 9/9 and tenant registration 14/14 pass, with no failures or skips. Evidence: [2026-10-04](docs/testing/role/professional-access-personas/2026-10-04.md). Deployed acceptance remains pending.

## Adding the next lock

Append the next entry; do not rewrite or erase historical locked evidence. If a
new authorized requirement intentionally conflicts with a lock, mark the old
entry `SUPERSEDED` with a link to the user's decision and the replacement lock.
Keep the earlier report available.
