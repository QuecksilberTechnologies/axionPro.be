/*
  Populate axionpro."District" from the existing axionpro."City" catalog.

  Why this keeps the source City Id:
  The current tenant-location UI requests /location/district/option but persists
  the selected value as TenantLocation.CityId.  Keeping District.Id = City.Id
  preserves the existing client contract and guarantees that every selected
  district value is also a valid City foreign key.

  Scope:
  - Inserts one District for every City that does not already have the same Id.
  - Does not alter or delete City rows.
  - Refuses to run if District already contains data, so it cannot merge an
    unrelated district catalog by accident.

  Usage:
  1. Run as-is to see the preview result only.
  2. Change ONLY ExecuteInsert from FALSE to TRUE, then run the entire file.
