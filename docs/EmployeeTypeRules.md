# EmployeeType Rules

## Scope and ownership

- `EmployeeType` is tenant-owned. The authenticated Tenant and employee audit actor are authoritative; clients never supply either value.
- All EmployeeType CRUD actions use the existing `EmployeeTypePermissionBehavior` and `TENANT_EMPLOYEE_TYPES` module permission pipeline.
- `TENANT_EMPLOYEE_TYPES` is a Tenant-scope (`ModuleScope = 1`) leaf under the existing Employee Management hierarchy.
- Its master mapping and every Tenant-enabled operation contain only the canonical CRUD operations:
  `Add`, `Update`, `Delete`, and `View`. Their database IDs come from the Operation master;
  do not select by `OperationType` because legacy master rows reuse those numeric values.
  Bulk Import is not an EmployeeType module operation.

## Active and deletion state

- `IsActive` controls whether an EmployeeType is available for normal selection. It does not make a dependency safe to ignore.
- Delete is a soft delete of the EmployeeType: `IsSoftDeleted = true`, `IsActive = false`, and the soft-delete audit fields are recorded.
- No EmployeeType dependency is cascaded or hard deleted by an EmployeeType delete.

## Delete dependency rule

The delete API returns a conflict when a protected dependency exists. For tables with a soft-delete flag, only rows whose soft-delete flag is `false` or `null` block deletion; active and inactive rows both block.

- `Employee`: non-soft-deleted employee rows block.
- `EmployeesChangedTypeHistory`: history blocks while its related employee is non-soft-deleted. The history table has no soft-delete field of its own.
- `UnStructuredPolicyTypeMappingWithEmployeeType` and `PolicyLeaveTypeMapping`: non-soft-deleted rows block.
- Accommodation, meal, and travel allowance mappings: rows with `IsSoftDelete = false` or `null` block.
- `EmployeeTypeBasicMenu`: any mapping row blocks. This legacy mapping table has no soft-delete columns, so it cannot be safely soft-deleted or ignored based on `IsActive`.

## Change safety

- Rename uniqueness is Tenant-scoped, trimmed, case-insensitive, and ignores soft-deleted EmployeeTypes.
- Update and delete always load the EmployeeType by both `TenantId` and identifier.
- Preserve this document when changing EmployeeType entity relations, CRUD behavior, mapping, permission behavior, or seed metadata.

## Validation

- 2026-09-11: the focused EmployeeType automation suite passed 6 tests with 0 failures.
  Nine database-fixture tests were skipped because `AXIONPRO_BULK_TEST_CONNECTION` was not configured;
  they require the isolated `axionpro_bulk_test` database and are not treated as passes.
- 2026-09-11: live database verification after the corrective seed confirmed that both
  `ModuleOperationMapping` and Tenant 8's `TenantEnabledOperation` have exactly the four canonical
  CRUD operations for `TENANT_EMPLOYEE_TYPES`.
- 2026-09-11 release correction: handler response alias now uses the same existing
  DTO as repository/AutoMapper. Release publish passed; two new list/paging
  regressions passed with zero failures or skips. Evidence:
  `artifacts/bulk-import/employee-type-response-regression.trx`.
- Live bulk acceptance is complete: XLSX created two types; CSV/paste each skipped
  both. DB/report reconciliation passed. My-menu contains Add/Update/View; Delete
  grant and manual update/delete HTTP acceptance are still pending. The failed
  Render build did not deploy these local CRUD changes.
