# Render development API smoke test — 2026-09-13

Target: `https://axionpro-api.onrender.com`

## Passed live checks

- Swagger UI: HTTP 200.
- Tenant Admin login: PASS.
- Authenticated `GET /api/Navigation/my-menu`: PASS.
- `POST /api/Auth/refresh-token-v2`: HTTP 200; response data contained exactly `token`, `refreshToken`, `tokenExpiry`, and `refreshTokenExpiresAtUtc`.
- Anonymous `POST /api/Employee/update-bulk`: HTTP 401.
- Authenticated `POST /api/Employee/update-bulk` with invalid permission IDs: HTTP 403. This confirms the deployed authentication-versus-permission distinction.

Real access and refresh tokens are deliberately excluded from this document.

## Deployment-version blocker

The live OpenAPI document was downloaded twice after the user reported deployment. It contains `/api/Auth/refresh-token-v2`, but does not contain either `canUpdateVerificationStatus` or `reactivatedCount`. These properties are present in remote `main_branch` commits `81f4fcf5` and `8dfcaea2` respectively.

Therefore the live service is not yet serving the latest `8dfcaea2` artifact. Employee section metadata and inactive-master reactivation cannot be honestly marked live-tested until Render deploys that exact commit. No destructive Role/Department/Designation/EmployeeType mutation was attempted against the older live contract.

## Required final checks after exact commit deployment

1. Confirm OpenAPI contains `canUpdateVerificationStatus` and `reactivatedCount`.
2. Read an Employee profile and verify editable sections have `tabInfoType`; assignment summary sections have null IDs and `canUpdateVerificationStatus=false`.
3. Preview one disposable inactive Role with `IsActive=true`; verify `willReactivate=true`.
4. Confirm and poll the job; verify `reactivatedCount=1`, no new Role row, and existing Remark/RoleType remain unchanged.
5. Restore/clean the disposable test Role through the normal API flow.

## China/USA Employee identity check

Structured scenario report: [Employee / China and USA identity options](testing/employee/country-identity/2026-09-13.md).

- Created China employee `78N5XZW2` through `POST /api/Employee/create`; the Employee list confirms CountryId `2`, CountryCode `CN`, Nationality `China`.
- Live `GET /api/Employee/Sensitive/get` returned HTTP 500 for that employee. The old read path depended on PostgreSQL `GetEmployeeIdentityByCountryRule`; its definition was found in `axionpro.application/DTOS/SPFunctions.txt`, not in the executable migration/seed scripts reviewed. Missing/mismatched deployed function is a suspected cause, not a confirmed production diagnosis: the server exception and target function inspection were not captured. Commit `05390640` (pushed) replaces the function call with an EF query; the handler retains access checks and a tenant-scoped Employee lookup. Internal date fields now use `DateOnly`, and the confirmed EffectiveTo projection defect is corrected. Post-fix live verification remains pending.
- The observed live Country options contained only India and China. USA creation/testing was blocked by its absence from those options and was not attempted. Existing seed mappings include USA/SSN and China/Resident Identity Card only when matching active Country rows exist; they do not create Country rows. These are seed expectations, not successful live identity responses.
- Local focused result: 18 passed, 0 failed, 5 database tests skipped because the isolated DB connection was not configured. The new regression covers date projection; no replacement-query database pass is established by this run. Full command, coverage limits and remaining checks are in the structured report.
