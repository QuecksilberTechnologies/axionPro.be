Treat Module `PageName` and Operation `OperationName` as immutable identities during
seed and catalogue integration. Resolve permission IDs dynamically from the
authenticated menu; never hard-code the numeric examples in documentation.

## Mandatory document for every new API

Whenever a new API or endpoint is requested, add or update one handoff document in
this folder. Include:

1. Feature purpose, screen behavior and user actions.
2. Authentication plus dynamic ModuleId/OperationId discovery.
3. Every route, HTTP method and permission requirement.
4. Mandatory and optional fields with types and validation rules.
5. Copyable JSON, query-string, FormData and Excel/CSV examples as applicable.
6. Representative preview, success, progress and error response JSON.
7. Status/enum meanings, polling, retry, cancellation and report behavior.
8. Destination tables, persistence timing, isolation and retention behavior.
9. Exact automated test results and an explicit local/deployed status.

This handoff is part of the endpoint's completion checklist so another UI developer,
Claude or Codex can implement the frontend without guessing backend behavior.

Latest Render API evidence: [2026-09-13 smoke test](../RENDER_SMOKE_TEST_2026-09-13.md).

Scenario test evidence is organized by module, scenario and date under
[docs/testing](../testing/README.md). Every tested scenario must have a report
there using the [scenario template](../testing/SCENARIO_TEMPLATE.md), with exact
local/live status, inputs, expected/actual results and outstanding checks.
Current Employee example: [China/USA identity options](../testing/employee/country-identity/2026-09-13.md).
