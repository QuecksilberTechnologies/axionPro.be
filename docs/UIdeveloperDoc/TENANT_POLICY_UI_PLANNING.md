# Tenant Policy UI Planning

## Current phase

The persistence and permission catalogue exist. Controllers and endpoint contracts
are not implemented yet. Routes below are the stable module seed routes and UI
planning targets, not claims of available APIs.

## Screen evaluation

The professional flow needs **12 screens/views**. Seven are menu leaf modules;
the remaining five are nested detail/workflow views.

| # | Screen | Route | Menu module | Main responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Policy dashboard | `/app/policies/dashboard` | Parent landing | Counts, expiring policies, pending approvals and acknowledgements |
| 2 | Policy types | `/app/policies/types` | Policy Types | Tenant policy-type CRUD and category mapping |
| 3 | Policy list | `/app/policies` | Policy Definitions | Search, status, effective date and current version |
| 4 | Policy editor wizard | `/app/policies/new` and `/:id/edit` | Nested | Identity, rules, applicability, documents and validation |
| 5 | Version history | `/app/policies/:id/versions` | Nested | Compare, clone and inspect immutable versions |
| 6 | Applicability preview | `/app/policies/:id/applicability` | Nested | Test which employees/locations match before publish |
| 7 | Assignments | `/app/policies/assignments` | Policy Assignments | Resolved assignments, manual assign/remove and bulk import |
| 8 | Exceptions | `/app/policies/exceptions` | Policy Exceptions | Temporary overrides and approval status |
| 9 | Approval inbox | `/app/policies/approvals` | Policy Approvals | Review, approve, reject and publish |
| 10 | Acknowledgements | `/app/policies/acknowledgements` | Policy Acknowledgements | Delivery, viewed/accepted status and reminders |
| 11 | Audit | `/app/policies/audit` | Policy Audit | Before/after evidence and export |
| 12 | Bulk import/report dialog | contextual | Nested | Template, upload, preview, confirm, progress and report |

Documents belong inside the policy editor/version viewer, so a separate document
menu is unnecessary. Category, status, rule type and document type are lookup data.

## Editor wizard sections

1. Basic information: type, code, name, owner, currency and summary.
2. Version: version number, effective dates and change summary.
3. Rules: typed rule cards with schema-driven fields; custom JSON is an advanced option.
4. Applicability: include/exclude geography and organization filters with priority.
5. Documents: upload, language, visibility, checksum and document type.
6. Preview: matched employee count, conflicts and validation warnings.
7. Submission: approval route and final confirmation.

## Permission behavior

UI must discover ModuleId and OperationId from the authenticated menu/permission
response. Numeric IDs must never be hard-coded. Hide or disable actions according
to operations mapped to each module. A valid authenticated user without an action
must receive 403 when endpoints are implemented; invalid/expired authentication remains 401.

## Planned API groups

The next phase should provide API groups for lookups, policy type, policy,
version/rules/applicability/documents, lifecycle actions, assignments, exceptions,
approvals, acknowledgements, audit and resolution preview. Exact request/response
examples will be added here when those endpoints are implemented and tested.
