Every tested scenario has a report grouped by module, scenario and test date.
Start with [the report template](SCENARIO_TEMPLATE.md). This is the continuing
test-evidence index; API integration instructions remain in
[UIdeveloperDoc](../UIdeveloperDoc/README.md).

Add another module/scenario directory when that scenario is actually worked on.
Append a new run section for another run on the same date; use a new dated file
for a later run. Keep earlier failures and link the run that supersedes them.

## Existing evidence kept at its original location

- [Render smoke checks, 2026-09-13](../RENDER_SMOKE_TEST_2026-09-13.md)
- [Automation test commands and historical results](../../axionpro.automationtests/README.md)

These links preserve previous evidence; they do not claim a new test run.

## Status rules

- **PASS:** the stated assertion was executed and matched the expected result.
- **FAIL:** the assertion was executed and did not match.
- **BLOCKED:** a required prerequisite prevents the scenario from being executed.
- **SKIPPED:** the test runner explicitly skipped a test; include its reason.
- **NOT RUN / PENDING:** planned verification has not been executed.

Label each result with its environment. A local PASS does not establish deployed
acceptance. Do not reconstruct a missing payload or raw response as if it was
captured. Mark illustrative examples and code/seed expectations explicitly.

Record exact test names, counts, command, commit/build when known, and links to
sanitized logs or reports. Redact secrets and sensitive personal data before
saving evidence. Documentation-only work does not require repeating passed tests.
